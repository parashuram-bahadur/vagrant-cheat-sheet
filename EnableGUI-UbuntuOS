1. Get a basic Ubuntu image working. You should be able to boot it and vagrant ssh.

2. Next, enable the VirtualBox display, which is off by default. Halt the VM and uncomment these lines in Vagrantfile:
config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
  vb.gui = true
end

3. Boot the VM and observe the new display window. Now you just need to install and start xfce4. Use vagrant ssh and:
sudo apt-get install xfce4
sudo startxfce4&

If this is the first time you're running this Ubuntu environment, you'll need to run the following command before installing xfce4:
sudo apt-get update
That's it, you should be landed in a xfce4 session.

Update: For a better experience, I recommend these improvements:

Don't start the GUI as root. You really want to stay the vagrant user. To do this you need to permit anyone to start the GUI: sudo vim /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config and edit it to allowed_users=anybody.
Next, install the VirtualBox guest tools before starting the GUI. This will give you a healthy screen resolution, integrated mouse, etc.
$ sudo apt-get install -y xfce4 virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11
$ sudo VBoxClient-all
Only now should you start the GUI as the vagrant user, with $ startxfce4&.
Update 2: Tried this today and the VBoxClient-all script isn't always installed. If it's missing, you can replace with the equivalent:

sudo VBoxClient --clipboard
sudo VBoxClient --draganddrop
sudo VBoxClient --display
sudo VBoxClient --checkhostversion
sudo VBoxClient --seamless
